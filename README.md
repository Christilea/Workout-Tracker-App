# Workout-Tracker-App
This application is a MongoDB fitness tracker. The application should allow the user to add exercises to a previous workout, add new exercises to a workout, and generate a Stats page. Information is saved in the database and can be viewed later.

## User Story
 As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
